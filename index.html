        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describs how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li> <span class="strike">Css is necessary</span> <span class="colour">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li>

    <h2 class="para1">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files. However, 
            <span class="colour2">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier
            to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it your self.
        </li>
    </ul>
 
<div class="para2">
    <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. Id is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
     </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>This is a widw range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
